What I did today (5/20):

1. Began coding router initialization including:
	- Initializing the routing table
	- Creating a listening thread to accept connections to other Tor61 nodes
	- Registering the router with the registration service
2. Moved the registration code into the router class
	- The router must be registered before it can create a circuit (it can create a connection to itself, so it must
	be registered). 
	- The registration service is used only for moving data in between routers - this is not the job of the parent 
	node but of its router functionality
	- Node code becomes cleaner
3. Created custom class to use in the Map<RoutingTableKey, Connection>
	- Used Connection class because both RouterConnection and ProxyConnections will be endpoints.
	- Made the map synchronized to safely handle access by multiple RouterConnection threads
	- Overwrote HashCode and Equals methods to ensure that the class behaves as we expect
4. Fetch all registered routers
